# Advanced Challenge for ICP AI HackerHouse

Welcome to this tutorial that is for experienced developers looking how to deploy AI models on ICP, a decentralized cloud built on blockchain technology. Architected for being general purpose, the only limit you have is your imagination. üôÇüöÄ

On this challenge, the main goals are:

- to introduce to IC, in case you don't know yet, showcasing great examples of what is already possible
- to help you understand the process of building a model and deploying it on chain
- to hopefully convince you the IC stack and ecosystem is a great place to have a Dev career or co-found a startup.

## Challenge Overview

This challenge will be in Rust. We have prepared a Codespace for you, so you don't waste time on local setup and can go directly to the fun part, deploying a model on chain and coding! ‚å®Ô∏è

In this advanced challenge you will:

- Understand the "Python to Rust" toolkit for AI models.
- Build, upload the model to a canister and intereact with it.
- Build a tokenizers tool and a UI that allows humans to interact with GPT2.

The idea is to be very open (since it's an Advanced Challenge), giving you more room on how to implement it.

## Submission Details & Requirements

For the 150 (advanced challenge) ckUSDT prize, you will need to:

- Join the Taikai platform (where we publicly handle all the submissions): https://taikai.network/icp-portugal/hackathons/ICP-AI-HACKERHOUSE
- Create a project, following the instructions on the video, namely:
  - Title saying "Advanced Challenge - Your Name"
  - Add your github that allows to see the code finishing the challenge.
  - A video recording of the Candid UI (if you only implemented backend) or the Frontend (in case you implemented it) showing the dApp allowing a human to interact with the GPT2 inference method.

- Develop your Tokenizers solution (GPT-2's Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizer) (explained on Intro Video)

# General Instructions / Commands

## Getting Started

If you prefer running VS Code locally and not in the browser, click "Codespaces: ..." in the bottom left corner and select "Open in VS Code" in the menu that appears.
If prompted, proceed by installing the recommended plugins for VS Code.

### Running your Project

After the IDE has opened, run `dfx deploy` in the terminal to deploy the frontend and backend.
Click on the first green link at the end of the output to see your canister's frontend in the browser.
To interact with the backend canister, click on the second green link.
**NOTE**: When developing in GitHub Codespaces, run `./scripts/canister_urls.py` and use the links that are shown there.

For interactive development of the frontend canister, you can also start a node server by running `npm start`.
You can find your canister's frontend running under http://localhost:8080.

If you make changes to the backend canister, remember to call `dfx deploy` first; it suffices to reload the frontend canister's webpage to reflect the changes you've made.
If your environment was restarted or has been inactive over some time, you might need to run `dfx start` before running `dfx deploy`.

# COPY from rust-connect-py-ai-to-ic

https://github.com/modclub-app/rust-connect-py-ai-to-ic/blob/main/README.md

Seamlessly Bridge Python AI Models with the Internet Computer.

## Overview

"Python (design and train), Rust (upload), IC (run)" - this succinct mantra captures the essence of `rust-connect-py-ai-to-ic`. Our toolkit is an open-source solution designed to enable AI researchers and developers to effortlessly upload and deploy Python-based machine learning models for inference on the Internet Computer (IC) platform.

Focused on ease of use and versatility, `rust-connect-py-ai-to-ic` aims to streamline the integration of advanced AI capabilities into the decentralized environment of the IC. This project represents a pivotal step towards harnessing the power of the IC for AI, with potential future expansions into model training and user-friendly drag-and-drop functionalities.

## Features

- **Effortless Upload**: Simplify the process of uploading Python-based AI models to the IC using Rust.
- **Inference on IC**: Run your machine learning models on a decentralized platform, leveraging the unique capabilities of the Internet Computer.
- **Future Expansion**: Potential for extending the toolkit to include model training and easy-to-use drag-and-drop features.

## Getting Started

This section guides you through the initial setup of the necessary tools and environments for this project. We are using Rust with WebAssembly, Python with PyTorch, and the Dfinity platform.

### Rust Setup

First, ensure you have Rust installed. We will then set the default toolchain to stable and add the WebAssembly target.

1. Install "wasm-opt" and wait (average time ~12 minutes)
   ```bash
   cargo install wasm-opt
   ```
2. Deploy single_call canister

   ```bash
   # In one tab
   dfx start

   # In another tab
   dfx deploy

   # you can check the right links, by running script
   ./scripts/canister_urls.py
   ```

3. Upload model
   ```bash
   ic-file-uploader icp_gpt2 append_model_bytes src/icp_gpt2/lib/models/gpt2_with_kv.onnx
   dfx canister call icp_gpt2 setup_model
   ```
4. Call your 100% on-chain model
   ```bash
   dfx canister call icp_gpt2 model_inference '(14, vec {1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9; 10; 11; 12})'
   ```

### Python and PyTorch Setup

Ensure you have Python installed and then set up PyTorch.

1. Install Python (if not already installed): Visit [Python's download page](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Install PyTorch using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install torch
   ```

### Dfinity's DFX Setup

We will be using Dfinity's `dfx` for our development environment.

1. Install Dfinity's `dfx`: Follow the instructions on [Dfinity's SDK documentation](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/quickstart/quickstart.html).
